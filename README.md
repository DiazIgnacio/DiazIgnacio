<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<h3><b>About me</b></h3>

<p>Hi! I'm Ignacio Diaz, a Frontend Web Developer based in Argentina. I have a passion for all things web, and love working on interactive and responsive websites. I have a degree in Electronics from the University of Rosario, and have been working as a web developer for over 2 years. I have experience with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including:

  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>React JS</li>
    <li>Node JS</li>
  </ul>

My goal is to create beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites that are both visually appealing and easy to use. I am a hard worker and take pride in my work, and I am always looking for new and innovative ways to improve my skills. I am excited to start working with you and see what we can create together!
